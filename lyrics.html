        <h1>Empty out you pockets</h1>
        <h4>Juice World</h4>
        <hr>
        <pre>
            Empty out your pockets, I need all that
            Yeah, yeah
            G-money said, "We need all the money, man"
            Pennies and all that
            
            With G-Money, if I don't care if he got a million in all pennies
            I'ma be countin' Abe Lincolns all day
            Yeah, yeah, uh
            Empty out your pockets, I need all that
            
            I get the millions then I fall back
            Niggas chameleons, they'll change for some change
            The days ain't the same, niggas switch for the fame
            Louis Vuitton, I'm in my bag
            
            Get high then my memory gone, I've been hurtin'
            I rock like electric guitars, I be ragin'
            Countin' big knots, look like yellow pages
            I run it like a race
            Get in the way, brodie got the aim
            
            To blow you away, the next day
            You in the newspaper on the front page
            Prayin' for forgiveness 'cause it happened on a Sunday
            Back to the cash, rack after rack
            So many racks that I sag
            I just bought a bike, catch me doin' wheelies in the backstreet
            
            Like I'm from where Meek Mill be
            Put the dead in dead serious, you try me then you will be
            On my wrist, it's a ICEE, no, it ain't meltin'
            Turn my closet to a freezer, AP on the shelf (gleam)
            Everybody doubted me, they ain't give me no help (please)
            
            So all this money in my pocket, I'ma spend it by myself
            I bet you never felt this pain I felt
            When mom ain't had no money and them bills brought hell
            That's when G-Money hit my cell
            Next day, would've fucked up and ended up in a cell
            Oh, hell (fucked up and ended up in a cell)
            Oh, hell
            Yeah, yeah, uh (ended up in a cell)
            
            Empty out your pockets, I need all that
            I get the millions then I fall back
            Niggas chameleons, they'll change for some change
            
            The days ain't the same, niggas switch for the fame
            Louis Vuitton, I'm in my bag
            Get high then my memory gone, I've been hurtin'
            I rock like electric guitars, I be ragin'
            Countin' big knots, look like yellow pages
